				<h2>THE COMPANY</h2>

				<p>
					RisingStars Asia, a Singapore company, was established in 2011 as an online karaoke service provider company with its
					mobile application and website, launched in the Philippines. It spent three years developing its online and mobile karaoke
					platform which has the ability to produce TV quality sound and video recording even on average capability smartphones.
					Based on this technology, the RisingStars TV show is a game changer to the conventional talent show genre.
					It is the first to incorporate online talent search and instant audience challenge into a televised singing competition.
					In November 2014., after signing a partnership contract with the Philippine TV5 Channel,
					the first talent search has started with a lots of twists and suprises. RisingStars is the first TV show that captures the mobile
					trend into a TV show format.
