                <h2>THE COMPANY</h2>

                <p>
                    Rising Stars Asia is a Singapore based media company. Established in 2011, Rising Stars began by
                    hosting online singing contests through its internet karaoke and competition platform. The next step
                    was adding broadcast-quality mobile application recording, and many unique competition features,
                    including a fully integrated TV show format. The technology developed by Rising Stars has become a
                    complete game changer in the conventional talent show genre, which captures the current smartphone
                    trend, and seamlessly integrates it with not only the TV show, but the most popular social media
                    platforms as well. The first season of RisingStars Philippines was aired nationwide on the TV5
                    Network, Saturdays at 10 pm, starting in mid March 2014, and running for 10 weeks. The programme was
                    hosted by celebrity Ogie Alcasid, with Miss Universe runner up Venus Raj as his partner.
