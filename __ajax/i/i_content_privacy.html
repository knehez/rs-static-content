                    When you create a User Account, some information about your account activity will be provided to
                    other users of RisingStars. This may include the date that you opened your User Account, the date
                    that you last logged in to your User Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the
                    country and the number of songs and/or videos that you have listened to, watched or uploaded.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Your User Account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in
                    certain activities on RisingStars, such as when you upload songs, videos or send messages through
                    RisingStars. Other users can contact you by leaving a message or comment on the site.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Any songs or videos that you submit to RisingStars may be redistributed through the Internet and
                    other media channels and may be listened to / viewed by other RisingStars users or the general
                    public.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    You may also choose to add personal information which may include your name, gender, profile picture
                    or other details, that will be visible to other users on your User Account public profile page. If
                    you choose to add certain features to your User Account public profile page, then these features and
                    your activity associated with these features will be displayed to other users and may be aggregated
                    and shared with other users. Such shared activity may include your favourite songs and videos, songs
                    and videos that you rated, songs and videos that you have uploaded.

                    <br/>
                    You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through RisingStars, in which case you
                    can still listen to songs and view videos and explore RisingStars, but RisingStars may not be able
