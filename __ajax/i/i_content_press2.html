			<p>Enjoying the momentum of being Shining Star for three straight weeks, 16-year-old Rocelle Jeanne Solquillo of Bacolod is the favorite to win it all. “I am happy to be named the Shining Star, but much is expected because all eyes are on me. I will just continue doing my best to make my family proud.”
            </p>

                Her fellow BacolodnonLee’Anna Justine Weber Layumas also presents some stiff competition. Battling all the way from the regional screening rounds to the live shows, the 22-year-old has constantly been on top with her, with her angelic and very soothing voice. “I really hope that my performance will move the people.”
            </p>
			<p>
                15-year-old Remy Luntayao of Laguna has grown more mature and polished, progress she has evidently shown over the course of the competition. She is slowly but surely proving herself worthy of the tag “total performer.” “I was told that my talents couldn’t make it out of our house or barangay, and now I am here. I am proud to have proven them wrong, and I hope to continue doing so.”
            </p>
			<p>
                The youngest of the group, 13-year-old Krezia Mae Toñacao has been the resident OPM specialist. Continuously exhibiting grace and experience beyond her age, she has impressed the judges and hosts with her immense talent and even greater potential. “I will give more heart into my songs, which I hope I could make everyone else feel.”
			</p>
			<p>
                “The girls are absolutely amazing. I really look forward to seeing them shine and stand out more during the finals,” says judge and mentor Jaya. Papa Jack looks forward to whose performance will shine out, and who will break out as a star. For the last time, join co-hosts MicoAytona and Venus Raj as they discover newer sides of our contestants.
            </p>

            <p>Of course, Ogie Alcasid will be there to lead the charge. “It’s good to see that they have evolved as performers, you can see the difference from when they started in the competition. I’m expecting a lot and I’m sure they will deliver,” shares the energetic host.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of auditions, ten episodes, one winner. Who will be the inaugural champion of RisingStars Philippines? Watch the grand finals this Saturday, May 23, 10PM on TV5.</p>
