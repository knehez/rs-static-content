				The goal of the Production is to find amateur singers with talents of singing and special
				characteristics that enables them to perform in front of a big audience and that they can entertain
				millions with their performances. Amateur singers submit their favourite song as a contest entry on
				the free karaoke platform <a href="http://www.risingstars.ph" target="_blank">www.risingstars.ph</a>
				or the free RisingStars android app downloadable from Google Play. For those who lack internet
				access and/or who are not familiar with the mobile technology, RisingStars set up recording booths
				in well visited Malls nationwide at pre-announced time periods, where RisingStars staff assisted in
				recording the performances.
			</p>
			<p>
				RisingStars has revolutionized the talent search turning the smart phone into the key element of the
				audition process and the whole show itself - by utilizing the mobile technology, the web and social
				media. No more lines, no more casting call, all people need is talent, confidence, an android
				smartphone and internet connection to audition.
			</p>
			<p>
				No talent show has ever been able to reach out to so many people as easily as RisingStars with its
				top quality mobile app that turns regular smartphones into centrally connected karaoke machines.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the entry videos have been uploaded, contestants - turning to social media - can reach out to
				thousands of friends and followers to gain support and collect votes by sharing their unique
				facebook link in the competition. RisingStars seamlessly merges the power of mobile technology,
				social media and the TV.
