                    RisingStars Philippines is a televised singing talent show production, which was aired on Channel
                    Tv5 and the web and mobile platforms of <a href="www.risingstars.ph" target="_blank">www.risingstars.ph</a>
                    produced by RisingStars Philippines Inc. through 10 weeks, starting mid of March 2015, Saturdays
                    primetime. </p>

                <p>
                    During nationwide auditions which were held around the Philippines, from Metro Manila to Mindanao
                    RisingStars selected 37 of the best contestants to travel to Manila to participate the televised
                    contest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the Kick-Off phase, the 3 professional juries of the RisingStars Production made a collective
                    decision about the 16 contestants who continued to the live show.
                    Furthermore, 3 presenters supported the competition already from the audition phase. The main host
                    was Ogie Alcasid, the famous, popular singer and president of OPM (Original Pinoy Music). Venus Raj,
                    a former beauty queen and Mico Aytona, a talented singer and dancer acted as backstage reporters.

                    To maintain the continuous attention of the audience we introduced the unique “RisingStars

				<h2>CHALLENGE</h2>

				<p>
					All the contestants during selected weeks of the live show could be challenged by the audience or by contestants eliminated in previous rounds.
					The challenger could decide who (possibly all of them) to challenge, by singing and uploading the same song that the challenged contestant had
					in the previous live show on the “Challenge” platform of the RisingStars website or mobile app until a previously defined deadline.
				</p>

                <p>
                    Following the entry, the challenger could collect votes on the RisingStars website. The ones with the most votes had a chance for a battle with
                    the selected contestant in the live episode. In case of a successful challenge, the challenger became  regular contestant on the show.
