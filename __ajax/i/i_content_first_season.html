                <p>
                    The goal of the Production is to find amateur singers with talents of singing and special
                    characteristics that enables them to perform in front of a big audience and that they can entertain
                    millions with their performances. Amateur singers submit their favourite song as a contest entry on
                    the free karaoke platform <a href="http://www.risingstars.ph" target="_blank">www.risingstars.ph</a>

                    access and/or who are not familiar with the mobile technology, RisingStars set up recording booths
                    in well visited Malls nationwide at pre-announced time periods, where RisingStars staff assisted in
                    recording the performances.

				<h2>CHALLENGE</h2>

				<p>
					All the contestants during selected weeks of the live show could be challenged by the audience or by contestants eliminated in previous rounds.
					The challenger could decide who (possibly all of them) to challenge, by singing and uploading the same song that the challenged contestant had
					in the previous live show on the “Challenge” platform of the RisingStars website or mobile app until a previously defined deadline.
				</p>

                <p>
                    Following the entry, the challenger could collect votes on the RisingStars website. The ones with the most votes had a chance for a battle with
                    the selected contestant in the live episode. In case of a successful challenge, the challenger became  regular contestant on the show.
