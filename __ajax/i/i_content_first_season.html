                <h2>FROM PHONE TO FAME: STREAMLINING THE AUDITION PROCESS</h2>

                <p>
                    The goal of the Production is to find amateur singers with talents of singing and special
                    characteristics that enables them to perform in front of a big audience and that they can entertain
                    millions with their performances. Amateur singers submit their favourite song as a contest entry on
                    the free karaoke platform <a href="http://www.risingstars.ph" target="_blank">www.risingstars.ph</a>
                    or the free RisingStars android app downloadable from Google Play. For those who lack internet
                    access and/or who are not familiar with the mobile technology, RisingStars set up recording booths
                    in well visited Malls nationwide at pre-announced time periods, where RisingStars staff assisted in
                    recording the performances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    RisingStars has revolutionized the talent search turning the smart phone into the key element of the
                    audition process and the whole show itself - by utilizing the mobile technology, the web and social
                    media. No more lines, no more casting call, all people need is talent, confidence, an android
                    smartphone and internet connection to audition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    No talent show has ever been able to reach out to so many people as easily as RisingStars with its
                    top quality mobile app that turns regular smartphones into centrally connected karaoke machines.


                </p>

                <p>
                    After the entry videos have been uploaded, contestants - turning to social media - can reach out to
                    thousands of friends and followers to gain support and collect votes by sharing their unique
                    facebook link in the competition. RisingStars seamlessly merges the power of mobile technology,

				<h2>CHALLENGE</h2>

				<p>
                    To keep contestants on their toes and create a real drama in the show, anyone from the audience is
                    able to challenge a contestant by singing the same song through their smartphones. Running under the
                    (trademarked) slogan “I can sing better than that”, challengers can submit their version of the song
                    via the RisingStars website or mobile app. The best of those challenges submitted, as selected by
                    the judges, is then invited to join the live contest, and if they end up winning against the
                    contestant they've challenged, they will then have the opportunity to continue as a regular
                    contestant. With this format which keeps the contest wide open, anyone with true talent has a chance
                    to enter the competition, even at the last minute, just by using their mobile phones, true to the
                    “from phone to fame” concept.
