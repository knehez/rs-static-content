			<h2>The company</h2>

			<p>
				Rising Stars Asia is a Singapore based media company. Established in 2011, Rising Stars began by
				hosting online singing contests through its internet karaoke and competition platform. The next step
				was adding broadcast-quality mobile application recording, and many unique competition features,
				including a fully integrated TV show format. The technology developed by Rising Stars has become a
				complete game changer in the conventional talent show genre, which captures the current smartphone
				trend, and seamlessly integrates it with not only the TV show, but the most popular social media
				platforms as well. The first season of RisingStars Philippines was aired nationwide on the TV5
				Network, Saturdays at 10 pm, starting in mid March 2015, and running for 10 weeks. The programme was
				hosted by celebrity Ogie Alcasid, with Miss Universe runner up Venus Raj as his partner.
